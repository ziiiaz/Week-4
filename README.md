# UX Stroytelling - Persona
DH110 | Zia Khoshsirat | Week F4

# :page_with_curl: Introduction

>Storytelling emplaces the subject matter in a context and takes the audience on a journey through the researcher’s eyes and the subject’s action. In my opinion, storytelling promotes subjects from mere users to persons with a life that affects their decision-making, rise and fall of feelings, and how they interact with an issue. Storytelling re-contextualizes the user and the product in their real-time entanglement.

# :ledger: User Scenarios

### Zahra

> **Why Zahra is using this website?**
> 
> Zahra is an adjunct professor at UC Irvine. She has a Ph.D. in World Comparative literature. When she was 18, she lost her vision due to a stroke that affected her finger movements. When she heard that her friend was racially profiled, she tried to support her. She decided to find a way to see if it was possible to file a complaint against TSA officers at the airport. While this task takes her time, she is determined to accomplish it and show a sign of support to her friend.  Considering her disability, she believes it makes their friendship stronger. 


> **How does Zahra use this website?**
>
>Zahra is dependent on her PC’s voiceover and the website’s accessibility rate. She has to finish this task and start another one for her class at the university. Both are important for her: one is about her job and the other about her social life. She turns on the voiceover and does all the tasks based on what she hears back from the voiceover. DHS website is almost a perfect accessible website for Zahra. However, it seems the website does not show the pages’ title. While Zahra is frustrated and losing her time, she finally decides to skip the titles as they confuse her. She speeds up the voiceover, reads all the items, and clicks on the one she thinks directly to the page she is looking for. She finally finds the page. Now satisfied and happy, she copies the link and sends it to her friend.

### Carmina 

> **Why Carmina is using this website?**
>
>A 41-year-old woman, Carmina, is a successful fashion designer who lives in Los Angeles and designs for people seeking unique dresses. Recently, at the airport, a TSA officer asked her to remove her headdress. She believes it was unnecessary, and since that time, she has been trying to cope with the incident. Her friend told her about the DHS website and helped her to file a complaint. Since Carmina is not confident about her ability and knowledge of internet browsing and searching, she usually asks someone to do her tasks. Since her friend did her a favor, now she thinks she should check the complaint’s status by herself and let her friend know about the status. However, she does not know what to do and which website she should go. She needs to accomplish this task.  


> **How does Carmina use this website?**
> 
>Carmina uses her phone to search for the DHS website. She opens her chrome browser and searches for the website. She chooses the first tab from the main page and touches the back button until she opens the How Do I page. While still worried and not sure if this is the correct website, from there, she finds the For Travelers; she goes into the page; touches File a Travel Complaint (DHS TRIP); browses the page, and finds the check your status. However, she cannot find a way to see the status search box like what a user would see on the USPS tracking webpage. She accidentally touches one of the hyperlinks and realizes that those underlined blue words are hyperlinks. Her feelings shift from frustration to satisfaction when she touches the “status page.” She enters the number and calls her friend to let her know.
